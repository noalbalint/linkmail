    <p class="mt-6 px-5 lg:px-0"> Linkmail is an <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/noalbalint/linkmail"
      >opensource project</a> for accelerating sociopolitical movements. It creates a double efficiency: enabling
      activists to more easily write and share email templates, and enabling audiences to more easily send them.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our service is particularly useful for social media activists who don't have the capacity/budget for
      a website, let alone a dedicated email engine like <a
        href="https://www.newmode.net/home"
        target="_blank"
      >newmode</a>. However, larger organizations will also benefit from our low-friction technology.
      <br>
      <br>
      We also hope to encourage more people to become micro-campaigners.
      Political offices put more weight on individual/unique emails, so <b> a large number
        of individuals writing emails for their peers is more influential than a handful of NGOs writing emails
        for thousands of members. </b> This is our vision for Linkmail.

          The current flow for a standard social media email drive is some derivative of the following:
        </span>
        <ul class="pl-5 list-decimal py-8">
          <li>Click link in account bio</li>
          <li>Copy body text</li>
          <li>Open mail app + paste / reformat</li>
          <li>Switch to Instagram</li>
          <li>Copy subject</li>
          <li>Switch to mail app + paste</li>
          <li>Switch to Instagram</li>
          <li>Copy recipient email address(es)</li>
          <li>Switch to mail app + paste</li>
          <li>[[ Repeat as necessary ]]</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="pb-4 lg:pb-0">
          In the dopamine-saturated instant-gratification environment of Instagram, for most users this is simply too
          many steps and they abandon their message without sending it.

            target="_blank"
          >Linkmail</a> vastly simplifies this by compressing more information into the link being shared.
          The new flow is:
        </span>
        <ul class="pl-5 py-4 list-decimal">
          <li>Click link</li>
          <li>Add name</li>
          <li>Send!</li>
        </ul>
        <span>
          This minor improvement makes a huge the difference â€“ when it's easier to take action, more people do!

          NOTE: in both demos, you'll see that I must slightly reformat the email content. This is due to a
          problem with my phone specifically, and most users won't experience this.
