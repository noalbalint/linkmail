    In the dopamine-saturated social media landscape of instant gratification, user will complete only the most simple
    of tasks.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="px-5 lg:px-0"> Linkmail is an <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/noalbalint/linkmail"
      >opensource project</a> for accelerating change. It is doing for email campaigns what ApplePay
      did for online purchases: reduce friction to increase follow through.
      <br>
      <br>
      The service is designed for grassroots social media campaigners who don't have the capacity/budget for
      a website, let alone a dedicated email engine like <a
        href="https://www.newmode.net/home"
        target="_blank"
      >newmode</a>. However, larger organizations will also benefit from the low-friction technology.
      <br>
      <br>
      Offices generally give more weight to unique emails, so <b> a large number
        of individuals writing for their peers is more influential than a handful of NGOs writing
        for thousands of members. </b> This is the vision for Linkmail.

          The current flow for a standard social media email campaign is:
        </span>
        <ul class="pl-5 list-decimal py-8">
          <li>Click link in account bio</li>
          <li>Copy body text</li>

          Linkmail vastly simplifies this by compressing more information into the link being shared.
          The new flow is:
        </span>
        <ul class="pl-5 py-4 list-decimal">
          <li>Click link</li>
          <li>Add name</li>
          <li>Send!</li>
        </ul>
        <span>
          This minor improvement makes a huge the difference â€“ when it's easier to take action, more people do!

          NOTE: in both demos, you'll see that I must slightly reformat the email content. This is due to a
          problem with my phone specifically, and most users won't experience this.
